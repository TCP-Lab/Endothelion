better view in "kerblam data" (remote should be a sub of the branch above)

kerblam new could ask the user for a "paper" or "manuscript" "report" folder to put in .gitignore?

Creating a custom SubSetDF function that directly keep attributes to replace base::subset was excessively trivky beacuse of the non standard evaluation (see e.g., line ... where Mean refers to env = x but list_names to env=parent.env)...
As an extra benefit, this approach is explicit and remind the user that these dataframes are endowed with special attributes, important to the program execution.
use instead :
?dplyr::filter
